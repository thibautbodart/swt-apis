        description: Defines whether the Search API will try to infer the context from the search term. For example, a search for 'ILCE-6000' will understand that the context is this specific model and will return a best match section in the response. In case of best match, the results are retrieved based on the context that has been infered from the query term. (We are planning to rename this parameter to inferContext for consistency reasons)
